\title{Perform structure/reaction directed analysis for mass only.}
\usage{
getrda(
  mz,
  freqcutoff = 10,
  digits = 3,
  top = 20,
  formula = NULL,
  mdrange = c(0.25, 0.9)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mz}{numeric vector for independent mass or mass to charge ratio. Mass to charge ratio from GlobalStd algorithm is suggested. Isomers would be excluded automated}

\item{freqcutoff}{pmd frequency cutoff for structures or reactions, default 10}

\item{digits}{mass or mass to charge ratio accuracy for pmd, default 3}

\item{top}{top n pmd frequency cutoff when the freqcutoff is too small for large data set}

\item{formula}{vector for formula when you don't have mass or mass to charge ratio data}

\item{mdrange}{mass defect range to ignore. Default c(0.25,0.9) to retain the possible reaction related paired mass}
}
\value{
logical matrix with row as the same order of mz or formula and column as high frequency pmd group
}
\description{
Perform structure/reaction directed analysis for mass only.

\examples{
data(spmeinvivo)
pmd <- getpaired(spmeinvivo)
std <- getstd(pmd)
sda <- getrda(spmeinvivo$mz[std$stdmassindex])
