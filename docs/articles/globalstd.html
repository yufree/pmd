<a href="#introduction-of-paired-mass-distance-analysis" class="anchor"></a>Introduction of Paired Mass Distance analysis</h2>
<p><code>pmd</code> package use Paired Mass Distance (PMD) relationship to analysis the GC/LC-MS based non-targeted data. PMD means the distance between two masses or mass to charge ratios. In mass spectrometry, PMD would keep the same between two masses or two mass to charge ratios(m/z). There are twe kinds of PMD involved in this package: PMD within same retention time group and PMD from different retention time groups.</p>
<div id="pmd-within-same-retention-time-group" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#pmd-within-same-retention-time-group" class="anchor"></a>PMD within same retention time group</h3>
<p>In GC/LC-MS based non-targeted analysis, peaks could be seperated by chromatograph. We could build retention time(RT) bins to assign peaks into different RT groups by retention time hierarchical clustering analysis. For each RT group, the peaks should come from same compounds or co-elutes. If certain PMD appeared in multiple RT groups, it would be related to the relationship about adducts, neutral loss, isotopologues or commen fragments ions.</p>
</div>
<div id="pmd-from-different-retention-time-groups" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#pmd-from-different-retention-time-groups" class="anchor"></a>PMD from different retention time groups</h3>
<p>The peaks from different retention time groups would like to be different compounds seperated by chromatograph. The PMD would reflect the relationship about homologous series or chemical reactions.</p>
<p>GlobalStd algorithm use the PMD within same RT group to find independent peaks among certain dataset. Structure/reaction directed analysis use PMD from different RT groups to screen important compounds or reactions.</p>
</div>

<div id="data-format" class="section level2">

<a href="#data-format" class="anchor"></a>Data format</h2>
<p>The input data should be a <code>list</code> object with at least two elements from a peaks list:</p>
<ul>
<li>mass to charge ratio with name of <code>mz</code>, high resolution mass spectrometry is required</li>
<li>retention time with name of <code>rt</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I suggested to add intensity and group information to the list for validation of PMD analysis.</p>
<p>In this package, a dataset from <em>in vivo</em> solid phase micro-extraction(SPME) was attached. This dataset contain 9 samples from 3 fish with triplicates samples for each fish. Here is the data strcture:</p>

<p>You could build this <code>list</code> object from the <code>xcms</code> objects via <code>enviGCMS</code> package. When you have a <code>xcmsSet</code> object or <code>XCMSnExp</code> object named <code>xset</code>, you could use <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/enviGCMS/topics/getmzrt">enviGCMS::getmzrt(xset)</a></code> or <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/enviGCMS/topics/getmzrt2">enviGCMS::getmzrt2(xset)</a></code> to get such list. Of course you could build such list by yourself.</p>

<p>Retention time cluster cutoff should fit the peak picking algorithm. For HPLC, 10 is suggested and 5 could be used for UPLC.</p>
<p>Global PMDâ€™s retention time group numbers should be around 20 percent of the retention time cluster numbers. For example, if you find 100 retention time clusters, I suggested you use 20 as the empirical global PMDâ€™s retention time group numbers.</p>
<p>Another important hint is that pre-filter your peak list by black samples or other quality control samples. Otherwise the running time would be long and lots of pmd relationship would be just from noise.</p>

<p>An interactive document has been included in this package to perform PMD analysis. You need to prepare a csv file with m/z and retention time of peaks. Such csv file could be generated by run <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/enviGCMS/topics/getmzrtcsv">enviGCMS::getmzrtcsv()</a></code> on the <code>list</code> object from <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/enviGCMS/topics/getmzrt">enviGCMS::getmzrt(xset)</a></code> or <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/enviGCMS/topics/getmzrt2">enviGCMS::getmzrt2(xset)</a></code> function. You could also generate the csv file by <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/enviGCMS/topics/getmzrt">enviGCMS::getmzrt(xset,name = 'test')</a></code> or <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/enviGCMS/topics/getmzrt2">enviGCMS::getmzrt2(xset, name = 'test')</a></code>. You will find the csv file in the working dictionary named <code>test.csv</code>.</p>
<p>Then you could run <code><a href="../reference/runPMD.html">runPMD()</a></code> to start the Graphical user interface(GUI) for GlobalStd algorithm and structure/reaction directed analysis. The PMD network for certain compound could be generated by run <code><a href="../reference/runPMDnet.html">runPMDnet()</a></code>.</p>

<p><code>pmd</code> package could be used to reduce the redundancy peaks for GC/LC-MS based research and perform structure/reaction directed analysis to screen known and unknown important compounds or reactions.</p>
