Description: Paired Mass Distance(PMD) analysis including GlobalStd algorithm and structure/reaction directed analysis. GlobalStd algorithm could found independent peaks in m/z-retention time profiles based on retention time hierarchical cluster analysis and frequency analysis of paired mass distances within retention time groups. Structure directed analysis could be used to find potential relationship among those independent peaks in different retention time groups based on frequency of paired mass distances. A GUI for PMD analysis is also included as a shiny application.
